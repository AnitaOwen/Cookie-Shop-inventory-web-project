### How to create a cookie: 
- ``Cookie Name`` (required) The name of the cookie you want to add.
- ``Price``(per dozen): (required) The price per dozen of the item in dollars.
- ``In Stock?`` (required) Choose 'Yes' or 'No' for whether the item is in stock.
- ``Contains Nuts?`` (required) Choose 'Yes' or 'No' for whether the item contains nuts.
- ``Is Vegan?`` (required) Choose 'Yes' or 'No' for whether the item contains nuts.
- ``Image URL`` (optional) If you have an image you want to use for the item, paste the image adress here!
- ``Notes`` (optional) Here is where you can add any extra details or descriptions of your item.

>Note: Clicking the ``"Reset"`` button will clear the entire form.

### How to delete a cookie:
- Click the ``red "Remove Cookie"`` button under any inventory item to remove that item from the inventory. 

### Interactive Features:
- The user can dynamically update the "in stock" value for existing inventory items. 
Click on the ``red "yes"`` or ``green "no"`` buttton to change "in stock" to "out of stock", and vice versa.

- The cookie count at the top of the inventory list will show an updated count of all the cookies in the inventory.

#### Stretch goals: 
1. If an image URL is not provided on the form, a default image will be used for the new cookie item.
2. Helper functions were implemented to ensure that each function has a single concern, making the code more readable.
3. A footer has been created that sticks to the bottom of the browser window, even if all inventory items have been removed.
4. Clicking "yes" or "no" for "In Stock" will toggle the value for that item.
5. Transition effects have been incorporated to make the page more interactive.
